## Fitness Tracker
This is a fitness tracker app to help you keep track of different workouts.

## Getting Started
This project has been deployed on heroku using mongo db atlas. The models I created to track the workouts follow a
Mongoose schema. It takes the data input by the user and creates a workout then populates it into a chart for easy
viewing. With my api routes I used an aggregate sum function to total the workout duration.
